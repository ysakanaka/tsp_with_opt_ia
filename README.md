Google STEP 2017: Code Readability, Code Review (with NP)
====

8分割ののちgreedy、スタート地点はなるべくcenterになるようにしている。
交差を無くそうと2-opt、3-optも試したが悪化したので、局所解を求める方が良いかも。
4分割のものはsolver_division、8分割はsolver_division2
2-optと3-optを含むのはsolver_final.py　2-optと3-optの致命的な間違いは直しました。

Problem Statement
----

In this assignment, you will design an algorithm to solve a fundamental problem
faced by every travelling salesperson, called *Travelling Salesman Problem*
(TSP).  I’ll explain TSP in the onsite class.  TSP
is very famous problem. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
You can understand the problem without any difficulties.

Quoted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem):

> The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a
> list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the
> shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the
> origin city?

Assignment
----

The assignment is hosted on GitHub, [https://github.com/hayatoito/google-step-tsp](https://github.com/hayatoito/google-step-tsp).
You can download the assignment by `git clone`:

    git clone https://github.com/hayatoito/google-step-tsp
    git checkout gh-pages

I recommend you to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this
repository to your github account before cloning it.

This document doesn't explain “what is git?’ nor “how to use GitHub?”. It is your responsibility to master the
usage of git and GitHub.

The repository includes sample scripts written in Python 3, rather than in Python 2. It’s your responsibility to
install Python 3 if you want to run the scripts, though running the scripts is not mandatory.

There are 7 challenges of TSP in the assignment, from N = 5 to N = 2048:

  | Challenge    | N (= the number of cities) | Input file  | Output (Solution) file |
  | ------------ | -------------------------: | ----------- | ---------------------- |
  | Challenge 0  |                          5 | input_0.csv | solution_yours_0.csv   |
  | Challenge 1  |                          8 | input_1.csv | solution_yours_1.csv   |
  | Challenge 2  |                         16 | input_2.csv | solution_yours_2.csv   |
  | Challenge 3  |                         64 | input_3.csv | solution_yours_3.csv   |
  | Challenge 4  |                        128 | input_4.csv | solution_yours_4.csv   |
  | Challenge 5  |                        512 | input_5.csv | solution_yours_5.csv   |
  | Challenge 6  |                       2048 | input_6.csv | solution_yours_6.csv   |

See *Data Format Specification* section to know the format of input and output files.

### Your tasks

In coding phase:

* Write a program, solveing each TSP by designing and implementing an algorithm.
* Overwrite each solution file, `solution_yours_{0-6}.csv`, with the output of your program.
* Enter the *path length* of your solution in the [scoreboard], for each challenge. Needless to say, a shorter path is better then a longer path.
* Enter your git repository's location in the [scoreboard].

In review phase:

* Review other student's published code, and send at least one [pull request].

[pull request]: https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/

### An optional task (Speed challenge)

What matters in this optional task is your program's *speed* (execution time). The path length does not matter as long as it is meets the condition.

Your task is: Given `input_6.csv`, write a program which outputs a path shorter than `47,000`

Input your program's execution time in the [scoreboard]. Faster (smaller) is better.

You can measure the execution time by `time` command. For example,

  ```shellsession
  $ time yourprogram input_6.csv solution_yours_6.csv
  2.96s user 0.07s system 97% cpu 3.116 total
  ```

  In this case, your score is `3.116` (s).

### Visualizer

The demo page of the visualizer is [here](http://hayatoito.github.io/google-step-tsp/visualizer/).

The assignment includes a helper Web page, `visualizer/index.html`, which
visualizes your solutions. You need to run a HTTP server on your local machine
to access the visualizer. Any HTTP server is okay. If you are not sure how to
run a web server, use the following command to run the HTTP server included in
the assignment. Make sure that you are in the top directory of the assignment
before running the command.

  ``` shellsession
  ./nocache_server.py # For Python 3
  ./nocache_server.py2.py # If you don’t want to install Python 3
  ```

Then, open a browser and navigate to the
[http://localhost:8000/visualizer/](http://localhost:8000/visualizer/).

Visualizer was only tested by Google Chrome. Using the visualizer is up-to you. You don’t have to use the visualizer to finish the assignment. The
visualizer is provided for the purpose of helping you understand the problem.

Once you publish a git repository, you can also enter the URL of a visualizer for your solutions in the [scoreboard]
(e.g. [http://yourname.github.io/google-step-tsp/visualizer/](http://yourname.github.io/google-step-tsp/visualizer/)).

Data Format Specification
----

### Input Format

The input consists of `N + 1` lines. The first line is always `x,y`. It is followed by `N` lines, each line represents an i-th city’s location, point `xi,yi` where `xi`, `yi` is a floating point number.

```
x,y
x_0,y_0
x_1,y_1
…
x_N-1,y_N-1
```

### Output Format

Output has `N + 1` lines. The first line should be “index”. It is followed by `N` lines, each line is the index of city, which represents the visitation order.

```
index
v_0
v_1
v_2
…
v_N-1
```

### Example (Challenge 0, N = 5)

Input Example:

```
x,y
214.98279057984195,762.6903632435094
1222.0393903625825,229.56212316547953
792.6961393471055,404.5419583098643
1042.5487563564207,709.8510160219619
150.17533883877582,25.512728869805677
```

Output (Solution) Example:

```
index
0
2
3
1
4
```

These formats are requirements for the visualizer, which can take only properly formatted CSV files as input.

Schedule
----

### The class begins: 2017-06-23 (Fri) 5:00pm (JST)

The class starts. You must bring your laptop.

This class is a kick-off class for the assignment, and will be basically 3 hours
hackathon. You are expected to understand the problem and solve a challenge
with a small N. You can also try a challenge with a large N if you can move
fast in the class.

### Coding phase: From: 2017-06-23 (Fri) 8:00pm - To: 2017-06-30 (Fri) 5:00pm

The deadline of the final submission is the next Friday.

Until the deadline, you are expected to improve your algorithm and enter the
score in the [scoreboard] manually for each challenge. You can update the score
as many times as needed. I highly recommend you to update your score whenever
you can find a shorter path.

You can enter your git repository's location in the [scoreboard] once it is ready. Publish your git repository as soon as possible.
Other participants want to see your code even if your code is work in progress.

You can also enter the visualizer URL so that other students can see how your
salesperson is visiting each city in your solution.

Note:

- You can see and use code written in other students freely.
- Please try to publish your code as much as possible so that other students can see your code.

#### (Optional) Office hours: (2017-06-27 (Tue) 5:00pm)

I will hold office hours on next Tuesday at Google Tokyo office. I will be available until 9:00pm. You can come anytime and leave anytime.

How to attend office hours: I will announce it later at [GitHub Issues].

#### (Optional) Yet another optional task: Challenge 7: 2017-06-28 (Wed)

I will announce it on 2017-06-28 (Wed) at [GitHub Issues].

### Review phase: From: 2017-06-30 (Fri) 5:00pm - To: 2017-07-07 (Fri) 5:00pm

The next class starts in the next Friday. we have one hour wrap-up time. You may want to bring your laptop. Be ready to explain your code and algorithm.

After the class, you have one week to review other students' code:

- You are expected to send at least one pull request in this week. Please choose any repository to where you want to send a pull request.
- You might receive a pull request from other students. Please look an incoming pull request and discuss it with a contributor, and merge the pull request to your repository if the pull request looks good to you.
- You can send any number (one or more) of pull requests to any number of repositories. That is up to you.
- When sending a pull request, please mention **@hayatoito** in a pull request's comment so I can notice a pull request.
  I'll try to join the discussion in a pull request, and might review code as I am doing in Google.

I'll announce the most valuable contributor at the end of the review phase. Please contribute to other student's repository as much as possible.

##### Hints

Since GitHub doesn't allow forking the same origin repository more than once into your account, the followings might be helpful to send a pull request.

Assuming that:

- You are `alice`. Your repository is https://github.com/alice/google-step-tsp.git

- You are trying to send a pull request to `bob`'s repository, https://github.com/bob/google-step-tsp.git

In your google-step-tsp directory, which was cloned from https://github.com/alice/google-step-tsp.git, do the followings:

    # Add and fetch bob's repository
    git remote add bob https://github.com/bob/google-step-tsp.git
    git fetch bob

    # See bob's branches
    git branches -a

    # Create a local branch, bob-gh-pages, from bob's remote branch, bob/gh-pages
    git checkout -b bob-gh-pages bob/gh-pages

    # Work on local bob-gh-pages branch, as usual
    ....

    # When it is ready, push the bob-gh-pages branch to your repository, https://github.com/alice/google-step-tsp.git
    # Your repository is usually called 'origin'.
    git push origin bob-gh-pages

    # Create a pull request at https://github.com/alice/google-step-tsp.git with:
    # base fork: bob/google-step-tsp, base: gh-pages  .... head fork: alice/google-step-tsp, compare: bob-gh-pages

What’s included in the assignment
----

To help you understand the problem, there are some sample scripts / resources
in the assignment, including, but not limited to:

- `solver_random.py` - Sample stupid solver. You never lose to this stupid one.
- `solution_random_{0-6}.csv` - Sample solutions by solver_random.py.
- `solver_greedy.py` - Sample solver using the greedy algorithm. You should beat this definitely.
- `solution_greedy_{0-6}.csv` - Sample solutions by solver_greedy.py.
- `solution_sa_{0-6}.csv` - Yet another sample solutions. I expect all of you will beat this one too. The solver itself is not included intentionally.
- `solution_yours_{0-6}.csv` - You should overwrite these files with your solution.
- `solution_verifier.py` - Try to validate your solution and print the path length.
- `input_generator.py` - Python script which was used to create input files, `input_{0-6}.csv`
- `visualizer/` - The directory for visualizer.

Details are intentionally omitted here. It is your responsibility to understand the contents of the repository.

Discussions / Collaboration Rules / Code of Conduct
----

### Discussion

- I highly encourage you to exchange an idea between students. If you have any
  question, or any idea, please share it at [GitHub Issues].
  It is very important to share your question among all students so that everyone can get
  benefits from the discussion there. Other students may have the same
  question. Please feel free to answer a question from other students. I will join
  the discussion as much as possible.

- You might want to [watch the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/)
  so that you get a notification when new question is posted.

### Group

- It is okay to work as a group if you prefer. The number of members in one group
should be less than 5. Please use one GitHub repository per a group. You should mention who are the members
in `README.md` file.

### Code of Conduct

- You can get an assistance only from other STEP students or me. Please refrain from getting an assistance from any other person.
- Use your best judgment when using third party libraries. No one wants to review code which just uses third-party libraries.
- It is okay to use built-in libraries provided by programming languages.

Please see also [code of conduct](https://online.berklee.edu/about/code-of-conduct), if you are interested in, as a general code of conduct, as a reference.

Feedback from me
----

I will make my best effort to answer your questions via:

-   [GitHub Issues] for this class.

-   Office hours

I will review your code and give you a comment as much as possible, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

-   Your code is hosted on GitHub. I will use GitHub's code review system.

-   Your code is consistency well formatted. I don't see code which is not well formatted. That is one of pre-requirement to get your code be reviewed, in general.
    Please make sure to use appropriate code formatter, if you are not in confident.

-   Your code is written in one of the followings: C++, Rust, Scala, Python3, Python2, Java, C, JavaScript, Haskell, OCaml, and Lisp.
    I can't promise to review your code if the code is written in other programming languages.

Please feel free to [mention](https://github.com/blog/821) **@hayatoito** at
GitHub anytime if you need my help. I will get notified. I will make my best effort to give a comment on your code.

I will not comment much about your approach itself. I will comment mainly about the quality of your code, in terms of readability and efficiency (time and space).

You can also comment on other student's code at GitHub. Please get familiar with Git and GitHub, and use them effectively as a collaboration tool.
